A Markdown R file is available for the code, aswell as the html knitted version. All the datasets from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/ are uploaded on the repo.



Note on the race share from the side dataset, the sum of the percentage is sometimes inexact since I considered all cities independently of their population. I did it in a way that was feasible giving the data at hand, since a visualization by state is more appropriate. In doing so, the sum of the shares for the states is in general not equal to 100.
